# Classification of Hand Written Characters
Built a Deep Learning model to classify images of hand-written letters and numbers from Extended-MNIST dataset. Created a Neural Network Class from scratch and used it to build a simple ANN that classified images of 0s and 1s from the dataset with an accuracy of 97%. Compared performance of ANN and CNN models built using Keras with Tensorflow and obtained best accuracy of 87% from the CNN model. Used this model to classify images of my own handwriting and predicted 7/10 images correctly.
